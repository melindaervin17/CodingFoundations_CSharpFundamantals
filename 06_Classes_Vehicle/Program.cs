/*
	- Custom objects in C#
	- Have properties and methods
		- Properties: variables that exist in the entire class

	Keywords:
		- public: can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that refernece it
		- private: can only be accessed in the same class or struct
		- protected: can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class
		- internal: type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly
		- protected internal: can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it's declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly
		- private protected: can be accessed only within its declaring assembly, by code in the same class or in a type that is derived from that class

	Structs:
		- used from small data-centric types with little or no behavior
